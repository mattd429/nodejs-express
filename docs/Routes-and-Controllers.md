### Routes & Controllers

The Main things we need to create are:
- "Routes" to foward the supported requests (and any information encoded in request URLs)to the appropriate controller functions.
- Controller functions to get the requested data from the models, create an HTML page displaying the data, and return it to the user to view in the browser.
- Views(templates) used by the controllers to render the data.
